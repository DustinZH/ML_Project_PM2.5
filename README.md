# PM2.5 Prediction by Machine Learning
This is our Machine Learning project. We want to use Linear Regression/LASSO/Neural Network to predict PM2.5 in China.

---------------------------
## First Step: Data CollectionÂ 

At the beginning of our project, we need to find a huge property data Source and the data also need some attibutes, which can support us to do more fancy test in Machine Learning. Because a small data set always cases data overfit. Fortunately, we found 2 million rows dat of PM2.5 in Harvard CGA website. Now let's us to do the project ! 

Because GitHub's file size limit of 100MB, you can find the original pm2.5 data source here:

## Second Step: Data Extraction and Clean
